# Citation Prediction of Research Articles using Deep Learning

This repository presents a deep learning approach to predicting citations of research articles from the Web of Science dataset. The data spans articles published between 2013 and 2021, including their citation counts and various other features.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: 
  - Cleaned and preprocessed using Python libraries such as NLTK, pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and spacy.
- **Feature Engineering**: 
  - Top 10 features selected through three algorithms: Information Gain, Gini Index, and Gain Ratio.
- **Models Used**: 
  - Machine learning and deep learning models to predict article citations, achieving 88% accuracy.

## Feature Selection
